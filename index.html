      Enterprise Services is making some organisational changes to some of our teams. As a result of these changes a number of positions will become redundant, and some employees will be impacted. While we will actively look to redeploy as many employees as we can into other roles within CBA, the unfortunate likelihood is that some employees will be leaving us.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      We are committed to making the process as easy as it can be, and are providing a career transition program that offers a range of career and personal support services. Leading through such change is challenging and stressful, and so we are also providing training and support for leaders whose teams are impacted. On this site you will find a range of information about the changes and support programs. Access to some of the content is restricted to just those employees to whom it is directly relevant.

        <div class="faq">
          <div class="faq-q">What is a technical career pathway within ES?</div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            <p>Traditionally individuals have progressed in Enterprise Services by taking on people leadership responsibilities in order to become more senior. As we continue to evolve from a bank to a digitally enabled organisation, deep technical skills are in high demand and we need to recognise and support these individuals.</p>

            <p>We have designed an alternative path where employees are recognised and rewarded for technical leadership, providing them with a clear path for advancement, alongside the traditional people leadership career pathway.</p>

            <p>We have identified 4 areas with the greatest current need for Technical Pathways in ES and they are: Analytics, Architecture, Engineering and Cyber.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
          <div class="faq-q">As an employee, what does this mean for my career?</div>
          <div class="faq-a">Individuals can identify the most appropriate pathway based on their interests and skills. Current or aspiring people leaders can pursue a management pathway if desired and technical leaders can continue to build their deep technical skills/expertise.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
          <div class="faq-q">How do I use this to guide my career?</div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            The technical career pathway is a framework to help support career progression and recognition for both people leaders and more technically focussed individuals. It is not prescriptive but can help you understand how your current skills or role align to other roles within the framework and what you may need to develop to progress or change role. It also provides a useful reference point for career conversations with your manager.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
          <div class="faq-q">Should my current or future job title be updated to align with Technical Pathways roles?</div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            As a framework, Technical Pathways roles should be interpreted as reference points only. Your job title may be tailored to reflect the specialist field or body of knowledge of your practice.
          </div>

        <div class="faq">
          <div class="faq-q">Does this mean my role will change?</div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            Your current role won’t change as a result of the Technical Career Pathway being introduced.

        <div class="faq">
          <div class="faq-q">Does this mean I don’t have to manage people to get promoted?</div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            The technical career pathway will allow you to be recognised in more senior roles without having to move into people management. Your primary focus will be technical thought leadership and work, however depending on your individual team structure and your career aspirations, you may have a small team under you at some point.

          <div class="faq-q">
            Can I move between the 2 pathways if I decide I want to manage people later on?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            Yes lateral movements may depend on your broader skillset and the individual role you are considering.

          <div class="faq-q">
            Why is my role not included?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            Business leaders in consultation with HR have identified technical roles based on those areas where technical skills are currently in highest demand and therefore have the greatest need for a Technical Pathway. We will focus on these roles initially and review these in the future.

            Isn’t the Platform model about T-shaping? How does this align?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            Yes, there is an element of t-shaping involved with the new project/Delivery Excellence Framework. We recognise that broad knowledge and cross-skilling will continue to be key factors to the ongoing investment and development of our people. Complementing this, deep technical expertise will be required to enable Platforms, and provide subject matter expertise across a flexible workforce.

            By creating dual pathways for ES employees, there is a clear pathway for technical leaders to progress their careers whilst continuing to build their technical expertise.

            Is this framework final?

          <div class="faq-a">
            The framework will continue to be reviewed to understand what’s working well and what may need rethinking.

            How does this impact other key HR processes (performance and remuneration review etc.)?

            We will align framework to existing Group people processes, so there will be no change.

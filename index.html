      <p class="ldr-p">
        As part of ES’ strategy to deliver what matters at high velocity, high availability, low risk and the best value, we are making some changes to the structure and composition of some of our teams.
      </p>
      <p class="ldr-p">
        The changes we are making will help us to:
      </p>
      <ul class="main-ul">
        <li>Help us to further embed our operating model and ways of working – moving from project-based delivery  to agile, using squads and scrums</li>
        <li>Reduce focus and resourcing on activities that aren’t a priority for our customers or business</li>
        <li>Increase our pace and agility</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="ldr-p">
        As a result of these changes a number of positions will become redundant, and some employees will be impacted. While we will actively look to redeploy as many employees as we can into other roles within CBA, the unfortunate likelihood is that some employees will be leaving us.

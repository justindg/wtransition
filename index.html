      As part of ES’ strategy to deliver what matters at high velocity, high availability, low risk and the best value, we are making some changes to the structure and composition of some of our teams.
    </p>

    <p class="ldr-p">
      The changes we are making will help us to:
    </p>

    <ul class="main-ul">
      <li>Create cost effective and scalable teams</li>
      <li>Increase our pace and agility</li>
      <li>Help set us up with the skills and capabilities we need for the future; both those we need more of and those we need less of</li>
      <li>Reduce focus and resourcing on activities that aren’t a priority for our customers or business</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="ldr-p">
      As a result of these changes a number of positions will become redundant, and some employees will be impacted. While we will actively look to redeploy as many employees as we can into other roles within CBA, the unfortunate likelihood is that some employees will be leaving us.
    </p>

    <p class="ldr-p">
      We are committed to making the process as easy as it can be, and are providing a new and enhanced career transition program that offers a range of career and personal support services. Leading through such change is challenging and stressful, and so we are also providing training and support for leaders whose teams are impacted.
    </p>

    <p class="ldr-p">
      On this site you will find a range of information about the changes and support programs.

          <ul class="acc-ul">
            <li>ES’s strategy (the atom) remains the guiding light for everything we do. That is, delivering what matters at high velocity, high availability, low risk and the best value.</li>
            <li>To achieve this strategy we have implemented new ways of working. These ways of working can be summarised into the following four categories:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>A shared plan – with a partnership you share the same assets and risks. Agree on mutual goals and how to tackle challenges. Together the business and ES will work in partnership. </li>
              <li>One team. One dream – it is about developing the culture for our future to ensure what we do, say and value reinforces our strategy.</li>
              <li>Being Agile – agile is a mindset. At the core are purposeful scrum teams. We adopt agile principles within how we work collaboratively, think and deliver outcomes.</li>
              <li>Moving faster, easier, cheaper and safer – process and automation are being developed at an amazing pace. This gives us levers we can use to save time, maintain safety, reduce steps and costs.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The key outcomes of this new way of working are:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Joint accountability for technology decisions and outcomes</li>
              <li>Everyone having operational awareness </li>
              <li>Prioritising and doing the most important/ valuable things first</li>

          <ul class="acc-ul">
            <li>Absolutely. We are confident that CBA and ES will remain a great place to work. Our proof points will be:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Teams will get to work on the things that matter to our customers</li>
              <li>Hybrid cloud services will be used across the Group </li>
              <li>Automation will be a reality and removing the operational tasks from our roles</li>
              <li>Everyone will be agile in their approach to work, with scrum teams focusing on what will make the biggest difference</li>
              <li>We will have better relationships with our Partners</li>
              <li>Platform teams will be able to prioritise, simplify and scale with ease</li>
              <li>Risk will be deeply embedded in our processes and culture</li>
              <li>There will be joint accountability between the business and ES for technology decisions </li>

  <div class="ldr-content">
    <p class="ldr-p">
      As part of ES’ strategy to deliver what matters at high velocity, high availability, low risk and the best value, we are making some changes to the structure and composition of some of our teams.
    </p>
    <p class="ldr-p">
      The changes we are making will help us to:
    </p>
    <ul class="main-ul">
      <li>Create cost effective and scalable teams</li>
      <li>Increase our pace and agility</li>
      <li>Help set us up with the skills and capabilities we need for the future; both those we need more of and those we need less of</li>
      <li>Reduce focus and resourcing on activities that aren’t a priority for our customers or business</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="ldr-p">
      As a result of these changes a number of positions will become redundant, and some employees will be impacted. While we will actively look to redeploy as many employees as we can into other roles within CBA, the unfortunate likelihood is that some employees will be leaving us.
    </p>
    <p class="ldr-p">
      We are committed to making the process as easy as it can be, and are providing a new and enhanced career transition program that offers a range of career and personal support services.

    <p class="ldr-p">
      On this site you will find a range of information about the changes and support programs.

      <div class="description">
        <div class="faq">
          <div class="faq-q">What is a technical career pathway within ES?</div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            <p>Traditionally individuals have progressed in Enterprise Services by taking on people leadership responsibilities in order to become more senior. As we continue to evolve from a bank to a digitally enabled organisation, deep technical skills are in high demand and we need to recognise and support these individuals.</p>

            <p>We have designed an alternative path where employees are recognised and rewarded for technical leadership, providing them with a clear path for advancement, alongside the traditional people leadership career pathway.</p>

            <p>We have identified 4 areas with the greatest current need for Technical Pathways in ES and they are: Analytics, Architecture, Engineering and Cyber.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
          <div class="faq-q">As an employee, what does this mean for my career?</div>
          <div class="faq-a">Individuals can identify the most appropriate pathway based on their interests and skills. Current or aspiring people leaders can pursue a management pathway if desired and technical leaders can continue to build their deep technical skills/expertise.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
          <div class="faq-q">How do I use this to guide my career?</div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            The technical career pathway is a framework to help support career progression and recognition for both people leaders and more technically focussed individuals. It is not prescriptive but can help you understand how your current skills or role align to other roles within the framework and what you may need to develop to progress or change role. It also provides a useful reference point for career conversations with your manager.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
          <div class="faq-q">Should my current or future job title be updated to align with Technical Pathways roles?</div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            As a framework, Technical Pathways roles should be interpreted as reference points only. Your job title may be tailored to reflect the specialist field or body of knowledge of your practice.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
          <div class="faq-q">Does this mean my role will change?</div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            Your current role won’t change as a result of the Technical Career Pathway being introduced.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
          <div class="faq-q">Does this mean I don’t have to manage people to get promoted?</div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            The technical career pathway will allow you to be recognised in more senior roles without having to move into people management. Your primary focus will be technical thought leadership and work, however depending on your individual team structure and your career aspirations, you may have a small team under you at some point.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
          <div class="faq-q">
            Can I move between the 2 pathways if I decide I want to manage people later on?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            Yes lateral movements may depend on your broader skillset and the individual role you are considering.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
          <div class="faq-q">
            Why is my role not included?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            Business leaders in consultation with HR have identified technical roles based on those areas where technical skills are currently in highest demand and therefore have the greatest need for a Technical Pathway. We will focus on these roles initially and review these in the future.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
          <div class="faq-q">
            Isn’t the Platform model about T-shaping? How does this align?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            Yes, there is an element of t-shaping involved with the new project/Delivery Excellence Framework. We recognise that broad knowledge and cross-skilling will continue to be key factors to the ongoing investment and development of our people. Complementing this, deep technical expertise will be required to enable Platforms, and provide subject matter expertise across a flexible workforce.

        </div>

        <div class="faq">
          <div class="faq-q">
            What does success look like?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            By creating dual pathways for ES employees, there is a clear pathway for technical leaders to progress their careers whilst continuing to build their technical expertise.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
          <div class="faq-q">
            Is this framework final?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            The framework will continue to be reviewed to understand what’s working well and what may need rethinking.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
          <div class="faq-q">
            How does this impact other key HR processes (performance and remuneration review etc.)?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            We will align framework to existing Group people processes, so there will be no change.
